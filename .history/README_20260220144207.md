# MeetTrace (Chrome Extension)

Scrape live captions from a Google Meet and save them as a `.txt` transcript, or record the current Google Meet tab (video + audio) to a `.webm` file. Optionally, mix in your microphone so your own voice is included in the recording.

## Features

**Transcript saver** – parses Google Meet’s live captions and downloads a timestamped .txt file.

**Tab recorder** – captures Google Meet tab video + audio into a .webm via MediaRecorder.

**Optional mic mix** – include your microphone in the recording (once you grant permission).

**MV3/Offscreen architecture** – recording runs in a hidden offscreen document.

## How it works (high level)

1. Content script watches the Google Meet caption DOM and buffers text with timestamps.

2. Popup lets you download the transcript or control recording.

3. Background service worker creates/coordinates an offscreen document and requests the correct capture streamId for the active tab.

4. Offscreen page captures the tab, optionally mixes microphone audio, records, and hands the blob back for download.

## Requirements

**Google Chrome** (or Chromium-based browser) with `Manifest V3` support and the `Offscreen API`.

**Node.js 18+** and **npm** (or **pnpm/yarn**) to build the extension.

The extension uses the following Chrome permissions:
`activeTab`, `downloads`, `tabCapture`, `offscreen`, `storage`, `tabs`, `desktopCapture`
and is scoped to `https://meet.google.com/*`.

## Quick start
1) Clone and install
```
git clone https://github.com/recallai/chrome-recording-transcription-extension.git
cd meet-trace
npm install
```

2) Build
```
npm run build   # outputs to `./dist`
```

3) Load into Chrome
- Open `chrome://extensions`
- Toggle "Developer mode" (top right)
- Click "Load unpacked"
- Select the `./dist` folder


Open a Google Meet, click the extension icon:
 - **Download Transcript** – saves a `.txt` of the live captions (turn captions ON in Google Meet).
 - **Enable Microphone** – grants mic permission so your voice can be mixed into recordings.
 - **Start Recording (tab) / Stop & Download** – creates a `.webm` file via the Downloads API.

## Install & build (detailed)

**1. Install Node**
  - macOS: `brew install node`

  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install -y nodejs npm`

  - Verify: `node -v && npm -v`

**2. Install dependencies**

```
npm install
```


**3. Build once (production)**

```
npm run build
```

This compiles TypeScript via `ts-loader` and copies the HTML/manifest to `dist/`.

**4. Load the extension**

  - Visit `chrome://extensions`
  - Turn on `Developer mode`
  - Click `Load unpacked` → select the `dist` directory that was created inside your repo when you ran `npm run build`

> During development you can also run:
> `npm run watch` which will force a rebuild on file changes (when you save a file)
> After each rebuild, click Reload on the extension (in `chrome://extensions`) to pick up changes. If you changed the service worker or manifest, you must reload the extension; for content script-only changes, a page refresh of the Google Meet tab may be enough.

## Using the extension

1. Open a Google Meet at https://meet.google.com/...

2. (For transcripts) turn on Captions in Google Meet.

3. Click the extension icon (puzzle → pin it for quick access).

4. In the popup:
 
  - **Download Transcript**: Turn closed captions on then hit Download Transcript after the meeting. This saves **meet-trace-transcript-<meeting-id>-<timestamp>.txt**
  - ** Recording **
      - **Enable Microphone** - Turn on before you hit "Start Recording" to capture your audio in addition to the audio of the other participants
        - The mic prompt may not appear reliably in a popup. If so, the button opens a dedicated `Enable Microphone` page (`micsetup.html`) where you can click `Enable` and allow mic access.
        - Once granted, the label changes to `Microphone Enabled`.
      - **Start Recording**: Starts a recording of the current tab (video + system audio). If mic is enabled and mixing is on (default), your mic is mixed in.
      - **Stop & Download**: Finalizes and downloads `meet-trace-recording-<meeting-id>-<timestamp>.webm.`

> The extension shows a “REC” badge while recording. All files are saved locally via Chrome’s Downloads API.

```

## Configuration knobs
- Mix microphone into recording: 
  - In src/offscreen.ts:
```
const WANT_MIC_MIX = true
```
  - Set to false to disable mic mixing entirely (tab audio only).

- Output filenames
  - Recordings: `meet-trace-recording-<meet-suffix>-<timestamp>.webm`
  - Transcripts: `meet-trace-transcript-<meet-suffix>-<timestamp>.txt`

## Scripts

`npm run build` – single production build to `dist/`
`npm run watch` – rebuild on change (remember to reload the extension in Chrome)

## Permissions explained
- `activeTab`, `tabs` – query the active tab (needed to target/label the recording).
- `downloads` – save transcript/recording files locally.
- `tabCapture` / `desktopCapture` – capture video/audio from the current tab.
- `offscreen` – create an offscreen document for safe/background recording logic.
- `storage` – store ephemeral recording-state hints (for UI sync).
- `host_permissions: ["https://meet.google.com/*"]` – limit content script to Google Meet.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

Q: What do I do if I don’t see any transcript text?
Answer: 
 - Make sure `Captions` are enabled in the Google Meet UI.
 - The extension only scrapes from `https://meet.google.com/*`.
 - Reload the Google Meet page after (re)loading the extension.

Question: What do I do when I see: “Failed to start recording: Offscreen not ready” or similar?
Answer: 
 - Open chrome://extensions, click Reload on the extension, then try again.
 - Ensure Chrome is up to date (Manifest V3 + Offscreen API supported).
 - Some enterprise policies can block offscreen—check your admin/device policies if applicable.

No microphone audio in the recording.
- Click `Enable Microphone` in the popup. If the inline prompt fails, a Mic Setup tab opens. Click `Enable` there and allow.
- Also check the OS mic permissions for Chrome (`System Settings` → `Privacy` → `Microphone`).

Question: Why is my recording silent or very quiet?
Answer:
 - Make sure the Google Meet tab is playing audio (unmuted).
 - If you muted the site/tab or Google Meet, tab audio won’t be captured.
 - If mic mix is on, confirm the OS/input device and levels.

Question: “Stop & Download” finishes but no file appears. What do I do?
Answer:
 - Check the browser Downloads panel.
 - If you have “Ask where to save each file” enabled, a save dialog should appear.
 - Some download managers/extensions can interfere. Disable and retry.

Question: Why are the popup buttons not enabling/disabling correctly?
Answer:
 - The popup reflects state broadcast from `background`/`offscreen`. If it gets out of sync, stop the recording (if any), then click `Reload` on the extension in `chrome://extensions`.

## Development tips

 - Use `npm run watch` during iteration.
 - Background logs appear in the `service worker` console:
    - `chrome://extensions` → your extension → `service worker` → `Inspect`
 - Offscreen logs: open `chrome://extensions` → your extension → `service worker` → look for messages from `[offscreen]`.
- Content script logs: in the Google Meet tab → DevTools Console.
